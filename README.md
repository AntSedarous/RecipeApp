Hacking away at a recipe app

This is my not-so-great attempt at making a recipe sharing website. It's been a fun pet project. 

In my next project I'll spend more time focusing on react/js-ifying things.

Highlights:

- Simple API setup to be able to pull together recipes and throw them in react 
- Functionality includes recipe creation, editing, and deletion; also includes liking and saving.
- Media uploaded is automatically renamed in order to prevent document collision
- Bootstrap is the main way of making things look not-terrible
